# announcment...

 CSX3 will no longer be in active development and now completely relies on community support. The reason is that i (DeniusG) have lost CSX3 files and since the version i published on the site was corrupted and had manyyy bugs, the team decided to discontinue it. We are now actively developing CSX4 instead, the new CSX. 

  I have been working on this since 2023, back when it was still called EclipseCode. Thats pratically 3 years of progress lost...
  This is the only remaining verison of CSX3 i could find. There was nothing else. Thanks for stickin around.. 

   (Youll soon be able to enter GitCSX3 on CSX4)




# Welcome to (Git)CSX3 ⚡
Web-based programming app for rookie programmers, with AI-helpers, Visual programming, and aesthetic pleasing features like Music, and themes. 

# What makes it so special? 🤔

Web-based programming means it doesnt require you to download any software. CSX3 can be accesed with any modern day browser. In fact, some older browsers like Internet Explorer support it too!

# What data does it collect? ℹ️

Rest assured, CSX3 doesnt need data to function. At the moment, CSX3 is a non-profit project, designed for people who dont have as many oppurtunities and knowledge as others, but have bold ideas.

# Where can i get it? 🌐

 CSX3's only public version was "CSX3 Browser dependent", but sadly, the website is currently corrupted and we have started working on CSX4

# Is there a community space? 🤝

Sorry, but currently its under renovation.

# What are the supported programming languages? 📗

The supported languages are: Javascript, LUA, Python, C#,  C++, CSS, HTML, Markdown, JSON, and X3, which is a python based coding language developed by Raven. the website is https://x3documentation.neocities.org/.  You can also view the code in Plain.

# Who is the developer? 👩‍💻

The owner is Raven and Me (DeniusG). I'm the founder of UQ and Raven is the owner of Pointware Studios







 hi! 👋 Im Aniku, the developer of this project. (fka DeniusG). You can find me on Discord with the username "deniusthepillowhead". I can confidently say that im a programmer lol. Im also the founder & owner of a dev team called UQ, which while is focused more on game development, is technically the dev team behind CSX3 i guess. Sorry if the updates take a while, im a dumbass who cant do anything right anyway so updates are delayed most of the time :p (I hate myself aaaaaa)
