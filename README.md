# ANNOUNCMENT! ‼️

 "CSX3 is getting discontinued?!" you may say.


 Well... yes 😨 But only temporarily.
 Development will probably resume somewhere about the start of 2026. Please wait patiently.

  For now, you can just contribute to the project and we will think about updating it. (We probably will, in December.)

   Cya until then! 👋 




# Welcome to CSX3 ⚡
Web-based programming app for rookie programmers, with AI-helpers, Visual programming, and aesthetic pleasing features like Music, and themes. 

# What makes it so special? 🤔

Web-based programming means it doesnt require you to download any software. CSX3 can be accesed with any modern day browser. In fact, some older browsers like Internet Explorer support it too!

# What data does it collect? ℹ️

Rest assured, CSX3 doesnt need data to function. At the moment, CSX3 is a non-profit project, designed for people who dont have as many oppurtunities and knowledge as others, but have bold ideas.

# Where can i get it? 🌐

Currently, CSX3's only public version is "CSX3 Browser dependent", but an app version for Windows & Mac is in development. Click [here](https://csx3-beta.netlify.app/)

As for me, hi! 👋 Im Aniku, the developer of this project. (fka DeniusG). You can find me on Discord with the username "deniusthepillowhead". I can confidently say that im a programmer lol. Im also the founder & owner of a dev team called Velarium, which while is focused more on game development, is technically the dev team behind CSX3 i guess. Sorry if the updates take a while, im a dumbass who cant do anything right anyway so updates are delayed most of the time :p (I hate myself aaaaaa)


# Remember, the app is in beta, so bugs/glitches may occur.
